# NLP-Based Automated Cleansing for Healthcare Data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **automated data cleansing in healthcare** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It processes unstructured and structured healthcare data, detects inconsistencies, applies corrections, and provides meaningful insights through visualizations.

## 🔍 Features
- **Structured Data Processing**: Identifies errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies in healthcare records.
- **NLP Analysis**: Uses NLP techniques to analyze and clean text-based medical data.
- **Automated Corrections**: Suggests and applies necessary modifications for data accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphical representations of cleansed data.
- **Summary Reports**: Provides a final assessment of data quality improvements.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy)
- **NLP Models** (BERT, spaCy)
- **Data Visualization** (matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (if applicable)
- **React & JavaScript** (for front-end if included)
